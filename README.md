# Titanic Survival Analysis 

In this chapter, the writter use the legendary dataset for many of data analyst. Here, the Titanic survival classification as the feature were built by machine learning calculation. This dataset was collected from Kaggle. For the begining, let me introduce the path of the project:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Developing the Predictive Model using Machine Learning

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

<h2>RMS Titanic</h2>

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.
